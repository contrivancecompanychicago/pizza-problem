A group of students are studying for CS 4532 exam. The students can study only while eating pizza. Each student executes the following loop:

	pick up a slice of pizza;
	study while eating the pizza
}

Once Kamal delivers pizza, he wake up all the students in the group. Then the students pick up a slice of pizza and go back to studying, and the process continues.
